the little game of pool
your job is to aim (using the crosshair '+') and hit the * ball
 with the o ball, with an appropriate force, in order
 to push it into one of the 6 available pockets...
the balls will bounce back when hitting the rim,
 and will collide according to the laws of physics
also, friction will slow their movement speed

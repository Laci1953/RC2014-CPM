Tower of Hanoi

You have three rods and some disks of different diameters,
 which can slide onto any rod.
The game starts with the disks stacked on the leftmost rod in order of
 decreasing size, the smallest at the top.
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to the middle rod,
 obeying the following 3 simple rules:
 - Only one disk may be moved at a time
 - Each move takes the upper disk from one of the stacks, placing it
     on top of another stack or an empty rod
 - No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it

Refer the rods using the digits 0, 1 and 2 (left ro right)

How many disks you prefer to use (2 to 9) :9

Move from (^C = quit) :

For VT100 terminals

Welcome to the archery competition!
You have to hit an apple sitting on a table...
, but it's not that simple, because the table is hidden behind a bushy tree.
So, the only chance is to shoot with a vault above the tree,
 hoping to hit the apple.
You can train for the competition, if you add any extra parameter
 to the command line... (e.g '>arrow t<CR>')

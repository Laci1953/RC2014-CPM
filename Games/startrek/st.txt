
1. When you see Command? printed, enter one of the commands
 (sav, nav, srs, lrs, pha, tor, she, dam, com, or xxx).

2. If you should type in an illegal command, you'll get 
 a short list of the legal commands printed out.

3. Some commands require you to enter data (for example, the
 'nav' command comes back with 'Course(1-9) ?'.)

 If you type in illegal data (like negative numbers),
 that command will be aborted.

The galaxy is divided into an 8 X 8 quadrant grid,
 and quadrants are further divided into 8 x 8 sectors grids.

Grid coordinates are numbered from 1 to 8, top to bottom, left
 to right, and a quadrant (or sector) is identified 
 by the pair (y,x).

E.g. the quadrant (1,8) is in the top-right corner of the
 galaxy, and the sector (8,1) is in the bottom-left corner
 of its quadrant.
  
You will be assigned a starting point somewhere in the galaxy
 to begin a tour of duty as commander of the starship 
 _Enterprise_; your mission: to seek out and destroy the fleet
 of Klingon warships which are menacing the
 United Federation of Planets.

You have the following commands available to you as Captain
 of the Starship Enterprise:

\sav\ Save = Save the current game to a file and quit

  You will be asked for a game number (0...9).
  The current status of the game will be saved to 
  the disk file STARTREK.SVn (n=0...9)

\nav\ Command = Warp Engine Control --

  Course is in a circular numerical vector            4  3  2
  arrangement as shown. Integer and real               . . .
  values may be used.  Thus course 1.5 is               ...
  half-way between 1 and 2.                         5 ---*--- 1
  Real values may range from 1.00 to 8.99               ...
  Values may approach 9.0, which itself is             . . .
  equivalent to 1.0.                                  6  7  8

  One warp factor is the size of one quadrant.        COURSE
  Therefore, to get from quadrant (6,5) to (5,5)
  you would use course 3, warp factor 1.

\srs\ Command = Short Range Sensor Scan

  Shows you a scan of your present quadrant.

  Symbology on your sensor screen is as follows:
    <*> = Your starship's position
    +K+ = Klingon battlecruiser
    >!< = Federation starbase (Refuel/Repair/Re-Arm here)
     *  = Star

  A condensed 'Status Report' will also be presented.

\lrs\ Command = Long Range Sensor Scan

  Shows conditions in space for one quadrant on each side of
  the Enterprise   (which is in the middle of the scan). 
  The scan is coded in the form \###\ where the units digit is
  the number of stars, the tens digit is the number of 
  starbases, and the hundreds digit is the number of Klingons.

  Example - 207 = 2 Klingons, No Starbases, & 7 stars.

\pha\ Command = Phaser Control.

  Allows you to destroy the Klingon Battle Cruisers by zapping
  them with suitably large units of energy to deplete their
  shield power. (Remember, Klingons have phasers, too!)

\tor\ Command = Photon Torpedo Control

  Torpedo course is the same  as used in warp engine control.
  If you hit the Klingon vessel, he is destroyed and cannot
  fire back at you. If you miss, you are subject to the phaser
  fire of all other Klingons in the quadrant.

  The Library-Computer (\com\ command) has an option to 
  compute torpedo trajectory for you (option 2).

\she\ Command = Shield Control

  Defines the number of energy units to be assigned to the
  shields. Energy is taken from total ship's energy. Note that
  the status display total energy includes shield energy.

\dam\ Command = Damage Control report
  Gives the state of repair of all devices. Where a negative
 'State of Repair' shows that the device is temporarily damaged

\com\ Command = Library-Computer
  The Library-Computer contains six options:
  Option 0 = Cumulative Galactic Record
    This option shows computer memory of the results of all
    previous short and long range sensor scans.
  Option 1 = Status Report
    This option shows the number of Klingons, stardates, and
    starbases remaining in the game.
  Option 2 = Photon Torpedo Data
    Which gives directions and distance from Enterprise to all
    Klingons in your quadrant.
  Option 3 = Starbase Nav Data
    This option gives direction and distance to any starbase
    in your quadrant.
  Option 4 = Direction/Distance Calculator
    This option allows you to enter coordinates for
    direction/distance calculations.
  Option 5 = Galactic /Region Name/ Map
    This option prints the names of the sixteen major galactic
    regions referred to in the game.

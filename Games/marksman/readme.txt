For VT100 terminals

The 'marksman' game

On a pool table (without pockets), a lot of obstacles
 are randomly placed, plus a target ('@').
Using any possible trajectory (including ricochet from the edges of the table),
  you ('o') will try to hit the target.
The computer ('*') will try the same.
Attention, hitting an obstacle will cause the attempt to fail !
Expand the window dimensions to at least 48 rows x 80 columns.
Hit any key wnen ready... and be patient,
 generating the game configuration will take around 10 secs !

For VT100 terminals

The game consists of 8 sessions in which, alternatively, you and the computer
 try to push as many stones as possible into the house.
Stones touching the edges will be disqualified.
Stones can collide to reach more advantageous positions.
The computer always pushes the stones horizontally; you can also push stones
 at an angle, for example to "hide" them behind the opponent's stones.
The one who places more stones in the house wins.

For VT100 terminals

You have to cross a maze with a '*' ball,
 in order to reach the '+' target
Once started, the ball will move,
 until it reaches the target or hits an obstacle
The maze is composed of horizontal corridors,
 connected by small vertical passages
In total, there are 16 different conformations of the maze
In the horizontal corridors, near the vertical passages,
 are placed letters or digits,
 which must be configured to allow vertical movement of the ball
For example, if the ball is moving to the right,
 and we want it to go up,
 we will place a '/' in its path.
Similarly, if the ball is moving to the left,
 and we want it to go up,
 we will place a '\' in its path.
Also, to remove a letter or digit from a horizontal corridor,
 you can replace it with a <blank>.
